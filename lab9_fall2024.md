## Objective
With this assignment, you will take a big step forward in your confidence with computer programming. The goal is to enhance your programming skills by using AI tools as a pair programmer. To achieve this, the task is to implement one of the midterm project ideas (assigned to you by us) that you did not work on for your own midterm. Throughout this assignment, you will interact with an AI model to assist you in developing this project for this lab assignment submission while documenting your prompts, errors, and thought processes.

## Introduction
What is Pair Programming?
Pair programming is an agile software development technique where two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the "driver," writes code, while the other, the "observer" or "navigator," reviews each line of code as it's typed. The two programmers switch roles frequently. This collaborative approach helps identify errors quickly and promotes knowledge sharing. In this case, however, your pair programmer is the AI tool that you would use back-and-forth to identify errors and together work on completing your assigned task.

## What are Generative AI Tools?
You may have heard about generative AI already, but if not, you've likely heard about "ChatGPT" or "Gemini", or "Copilot". These tools are based on "language models", which are trained to generate human-like text based on input prompts. Code generation is also, effectively, text generation. Therefore, many code generating models have also been developed like CodeLlama or CodeGemma. The advanced AI tools like ChatGPT have in-built code generation capabilities as well. They can assist in coding by providing suggestions, generating code snippets, and offering explanations. However, it's important to remember that AI is essentially a pattern completion machine. It can produce code that follows learned patterns but lacks genuine understanding or creativity. As a human, we still control the creative aspects of our engineering and humans can effectively look at code in a holistic manner to produce outputs that can be deployed in the industry. Advanced AI tools are becoming more and more potent in being an able partner in these activities though, and so, it's important that we know how to best utilize them.

Note: While AI can be a valuable partner in programming, it's not a replacement for your original work or creativity. Use AI to get frameworks or ideas to test, but ensure you understand the code fully so you can develop applications that are both creative and useful.

## Assignment Tasks
### Project selection
You have been assigned one of the midterm project ideas from the EE 021 Midterm Project Ideas Document. Your assigned project for Lab 09 is listed in this file Download this file.
The hardware aspect of the project must be complete to verify the results of your data analysis.

### Start a reflection journal: For this project you will be submitting a reflection document PDF along with your code and the history of your interactions with the AI. So, make sure to document your thought process, updates, things that you are struggling with, etc. Think of this document as your "journal" where you are noting down all information. 
Initial interaction with the AI and setting the groundwork

### Sign up: Begin by interacting with an AI model (you may use the most popular one: chatgpt.com). Make sure to sign in by creating an account if you haven't already created an account. Signing in and working on this lab assignment is important so that you can resume your progress at different points and share your prompt history for submission in this assignment.

### First prompt: Provide a prompt that sets the context so the AI understands you're a student learning programming and need guidance suitable for your level. Use the following example:

Starter Prompt Example:
```
Hello! I'm a student learning Python programming.
I've been assigned a project to implement [insert your assigned project idea in 2-3 words]. 
I'd like you to act as my pair programmer. 
Please guide me through setting up the initial framework for this project, providing explanations along the way. 
Do you understand the instructions? Say "yes" or "no". Don't write code yet.
```
Write down your first prompt to the AI. You will include this in the document you submit.

### The project blueprint
Craft a prompt that describes the project in a bit more detail and ask for a blueprint / test code that gets you started with the project.
Think about the prompt carefully. Have you described your request in enough detail (that is, is it clear what you want)? Did you think about the specific features that you would like that would complete this project?
You may test out various prompts in other chats to come up with one that you like. Include your finalized prompt for this part in your final submission PDF.

### Analyzing the AI's response
Carefully read the code and explanations provided by the AI. Note down what you understood from the AI's response.
Identify the features or components in the code.
List additional features you would like to add.

### Iterative development
For each new feature you want to implement:
Prompt Engineering: Write a prompt to the AI requesting assistance with adding the feature. Example Prompt: "I'd like to add a feature where the program can [describe the feature]. Can you help me implement this?"
Implementing and testing
Incorporate the AI's suggestions into your code.
Test the code to ensure it works as expected.

### Error handling
If you encounter errors, attempt to debug them. Spend at least a few minutes with the error. Try print() statements at various places to understand what the code is doing.
If needed, ask the AI for help with specific errors. Example Error Prompt: "I'm getting a TypeError when I try to run the code: 'unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str''. How can I fix this? Give suggestions for what I can try."
Document each prompt you gave to the AI. Note any errors encountered and how you resolved them. Explain what you learned during this process.
### Personalization: Enhance your project by adding personal touches.
### Relevant/realistic data/hardware verification
Use or generate synthetic data that's meaningful to you or that's relevant to this problem.
Incorporate personalized equations, formulas (from your ongoing courses), or textual data (sourced from the internet).
Update any code for the visualizations or print messages to personalize them according to your preferences and the need of the application.
User Interface: Improve the UI to make it more straightforward and user-friendly.
In your reflection journal, describe the personalizations you added and any changes that you made to improve the code.

### Finalizing the project
Review your entire codebase.
Ensure you understand every part of the code.
Add comments and documentation where necessary to write down what YOU understand various parts of the code does.
Confirm that the project runs smoothly without errors.
Include any real-world/hardware verification of your project.

### Submission
You will submit the following:

All code files: All Python files (.py) that make up your project.
A video of hardware verification.
Reflection journal (.pdf): This document must have an "Introduction" that describes the project and its objectives, a log of your interactions with AI and your thought process, and all your engineered prompts that worked well with the AI. End this document with a reflective essay on what things worked best, what you learned, what was the challenging part of working on this assignment, and if you have any thoughts on the next steps for this project. Note down any concepts in programming that you learned through this process, and any errors that you debugged. List the features that you personalized/added to the project and any other personal touch you gave to your project.
AI Interaction Transcript (.pdf): Save your entire conversation with the AI as a PDF. This file must include all interactions from the initial prompt to the final message.
Combine all files into a single .zip file to upload to Gradescope.
