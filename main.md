### Summary
This assignment challenges students to develop a personalized data science/engineering application by partnering with an AI pair programmer (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot). Students select or are assigned a project (derived from `lab9_fall2024.md`'s concept of using midterm project ideas) and iteratively develop it with AI assistance. A key component is the mandatory hardware verification of their project's results, ensuring students engage deeply with the practical aspects of their work, understand the generated code, and don't solely rely on AI. Students document their AI interactions, prompts, and reflections in a journal.

### Topics
- Prompt Engineering (crafting effective inputs for AI code generation and debugging)
- AI as a Pair Programmer/Coding Assistant (leveraging tools like ChatGPT, Copilot)
- Generative AI in Software Development (understanding capabilities and limitations)
- Human-AI Collaboration in problem-solving
- Iterative Development and Debugging (with AI support)
- Code Comprehension and Critical Analysis (of AI-generated code)
- Hardware Interfacing and Verification (e.g., with microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi Pico, Arduino, and basic sensors/actuators, to ensure tangible project outcomes)
- Data Handling and Analysis (specific concepts depend on the chosen project)
- Personalized Learning and Project Customization
- Ethical Considerations in AI use for development (implicit, via reflection)

### Audience
- **Primary:** Undergraduate students in introductory or intermediate programming courses (e.g., CS1, CS2, Data Structures) often using Python (as implied by `lab9_fall2024.md`).
- **Secondary:** Students in introductory AI, Data Science, or engineering project courses.
- **Adaptable for:** Advanced K-12 students with some programming background, or non-CS majors in project-based tech courses.
- *[Further refinement based on specific learning objectives needed for Model AI submission clarity.]*

### Difficulty
- Medium. `lab9_fall2024.md` implies it's for students who have some programming basics ("enhance your programming skills") but are still learning ("student learning Python programming").
- Estimated time: 15-20 hours (spread over 2-3 weeks, typical for a significant lab assignment).
- *[Instructor should provide guidance on project scoping to maintain this difficulty level.]*

### Strengths
- **Engaging & Personalized:** Students work on projects relevant to their interests or prior course ideas (similar to `lab9_fall2024.md`'s use of midterm ideas) and personalize them, increasing motivation and ownership.
- **Timely & Relevant:** Introduces students to practical applications and interaction with generative AI tools in a structured manner.
- **Develops Practical Skills:** Students learn prompt engineering, iterative development with AI, debugging strategies for AI-generated code, and critical evaluation of AI outputs.
- **Hardware Verification:** This unique requirement (stressed in the project idea) ensures students understand, implement, and can physically validate their solutions, preventing superficial use of AI and fostering deeper learning.
- **Comprehensive Learning:** Covers aspects of project lifecycle: ideation (project selection), AI-assisted development, testing, hardware validation, and reflective documentation.
- **Fosters Reflection:** The reflection journal (detailed in `lab9_fall2024.md`) encourages metacognition about the learning process and AI interaction.
- **Adaptable:** Project ideas can be varied; AI tools can be swapped.
- **Addresses AI Literacy:** Directly engages students with the capabilities and limitations of AI in a practical context.

### Weaknesses
- **Access to AI Tools:** Requires students to have reliable access to generative AI models (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot). Institutional support or clear guidance on free tiers is necessary.
- **Hardware Access & Cost:** The hardware component necessitates access to microcontrollers and components. While "cheap components" are specified, this can still be a barrier if not provided or if students must purchase them (target <$20-30).
- **Assessment Subjectivity:** Evaluating the "quality" of AI interaction and prompt engineering can be subjective. A clear rubric is essential.
- **Risk of Over-Reliance:** Students might uncritically accept AI suggestions. The hardware verification and reflection are designed to mitigate this, but instructor guidance is key.
- **Variability in AI Performance:** AI tools can be inconsistent or provide suboptimal code, potentially frustrating students. Learning to work through this is part of the process.
- **Time for Instructors:** Setting up hardware options and reviewing detailed student reflections and AI logs can be time-intensive.

### Dependencies
- **Knowledge:**
    - Basic Python programming concepts (variables, data types, loops, functions, basic data structures â€“ as expected for students doing `lab9_fall2024.md`).
    - Familiarity with signing up for and using a web-based AI chat tool (e.g., ChatGPT, as mentioned in `lab9_fall2024.md`).
    - **[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]:** Specific prerequisite knowledge for chosen hardware (e.g., basic electronics, how to upload code to a Pico/Arduino). This needs to be explicitly stated or covered in provided guides.
    - For some projects: Basic understanding of specific data science or engineering concepts relevant to their chosen project (instructors should guide project choice accordingly).
- **Computing Requirements:**
    - Computer with internet access and a modern web browser.
    - Python 3.x environment installed.
    - Access to a generative AI tool (e.g., free versions of ChatGPT, Gemini, or university-provided Copilot).
    - Microcontroller (e.g., Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, Arduino) and relevant sensors/actuators based on project choice (e.g., LEDs, photoresistors, temperature sensors, small OLED screens). Clear list of recommended, low-cost hardware needed.
    - Software for microcontroller programming (e.g., Thonny for MicroPython, Arduino IDE).

### Variants
- **Fixed Project Choice:** Instead of student selection, assign a specific project to all students for easier comparison, though this reduces personalization.
- **Simulation Only:** If hardware access is a major constraint, replace physical hardware verification with a detailed simulation environment (if feasible for the projects) or a more rigorous code review process focusing on robustness and edge cases.
- **Focus on Specific AI Skill:** Emphasize one aspect more, e.g., advanced prompt engineering techniques, or comparing outputs from different AI models for the same task.
- **Ethical Analysis Module:** Add a specific task requiring students to analyze and write about the ethical implications of using AI in the context of their chosen project or the development process itself.
- **Team-Based Version:** Students collaborate, with roles for AI interaction, coding, hardware, and documentation.
- **Scaffolding for Difficulty:** Provide more or less starter code, or more detailed vs. open-ended project descriptions, to adjust difficulty.
- **Different Programming Language:** While `lab9_fall2024.md` implies Python, the concept could be adapted for other languages if AI tools support them well and hardware libraries are available.

## Suggestions for Use
*(How other instructors can adopt and use this assignment, drawing from `lab9_fall2024.md`'s student-guidance tone but framed for instructors.)*
- **Initial Setup:**
    - Introduce the concept of AI Pair Programming, discussing its benefits (idea generation, boilerplate code, debugging help) and limitations (potential for errors, lack of true understanding, ethical considerations). Refer to the "What are Generative AI Tools?" section in `lab9_fall2024.md` as a basis.
    - Ensure students can access the chosen AI tool(s) and provide basic usage instructions (signing up, starting a chat â€“ similar to `lab9_fall2024.md`).
    - If hardware is new to students, dedicate a session to basic setup for the chosen microcontroller (Pico/Arduino) and demonstrate a "hello world" equivalent (e.g., blinking an LED).
- **During the Assignment:**
    - Emphasize the **Reflection Journal** from day one as a critical learning and assessment tool, not an afterthought. Guide students on what to include (prompts, AI responses, self-correction, learnings, struggles) as detailed in `lab9_fall2024.md`.
    - Encourage iterative development. Students should start small, get AI help for one part, integrate, test, then move to the next. Discourage trying to get the AI to write the whole project at once.
    - Facilitate discussion or a shared document where students can (optionally) post effective prompts they discovered or challenges they faced with AI responses.
    - Dedicate lab time or office hours to hardware troubleshooting and AI interaction strategy.
    - Remind students of the **Personalization** aspect to make the project their own and the importance of **understanding all code** they submit, even if AI helped write it. The hardware verification step is key here.
- **Assessment:**
    - Use the provided rubric, paying attention to both the product (code, hardware demo) and the process (reflection, AI interaction).
    - The video of hardware verification is essential to confirm practical application.

## Further Readings / Open Ends
*(Suggestions for follow-on projects or deeper exploration.)*
- **Advanced AI Techniques:** Explore AI for test case generation, automated code documentation, or more complex debugging scenarios.
- **Comparative AI Study:** Students could use two different AI models for parts of their project and compare their effectiveness, style, and ease of use.
- **Ethical Deep Dive:** A follow-up research paper or presentation on the ethical responsibilities of developers using AI tools.
- **Complex Hardware Integration:** Extend the project with multiple sensors/actuators, wireless communication (e.g., Pico W WiFi), or more sophisticated data logging and analysis.
- **AI Model on Microcontroller:** For advanced students, explore running tiny ML models on the microcontroller itself (e.g., using TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers).
- **"Rate my AI Pair Programmer":** Students could write a review of their AI tool, detailing its strengths/weaknesses for the specific tasks in the project, contributing to a class knowledge base.
