# Example submission: Temperature monitor and logger

This directory contains a complete example submission for the "Temperature Monitor and Logger" project. It is meant to show you what a high-quality submission looks like.

## Contents

- **`code/`**: This sub-directory contains the source code for the project, with versions for both Raspberry Pi Pico and Arduino.
    - `pico_temp_logger.py`: The MicroPython script for the Raspberry Pi Pico.
    - `arduino_temp_logger.ino`: The C++/Arduino sketch for the Arduino Uno.

- **`example_reflection_journal.md`**: This is an example of a good reflection journal. It shows how you might document your process, challenges, and learning. Your submission should be a PDF, but we provide it in Markdown for readability.

- **`example_ai_transcript.md`**: This file contains snippets of a conversation with an AI pair programmer. It demonstrates how to ask good questions and how to use the AI's responses. Your submission should be a PDF of your *entire* conversation.

- **`hardware_video.mp4` (placeholder)**: Your submission must include a short (1-2 minute) video of your hardware working. This file is a placeholder to remind you to include one. Your video should clearly show your circuit and the output of your code (e.g., the serial monitor showing temperature readings).
