    <h1>A student's guide to AI pair programming (note: this is adapted from various online sources and edited using AI tools)</h1>
<h2>1. Why good prompts matter</h2>
<p>Working with an AI pair programmer is like having a conversation. The quality of its answers depends heavily on the quality of your questions. A well-written prompt will get you useful, relevant code and explanations. A vague or confusing prompt will lead to generic, unhelpful, or incorrect responses.</p>
<p>This guide will teach you how to "engineer" your prompts to get the best possible results from your AI partner. Learning this skill is a key objective of this assignment.</p>
<h2>2. The four C's of effective prompting</h2>
<p>A good prompt gives the AI the information it needs to be a helpful partner. A simple way to remember this is with the "Four C's": Context, Clarity, Conciseness, and Constraints.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Context:</strong> The AI doesn't know what you know. You have to provide the background information it needs. This is the most important part of any good prompt.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Be specific. Vague questions get vague answers. Clearly state what you want the AI to do.</li>
<li><strong>Conciseness:</strong> Keep your prompts focused on one task at a time. If you ask the AI to do five things at once, it might do a poor job at all of them.</li>
<li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Tell the AI what it <em>shouldn't</em> do, or how you want the output formatted. This helps guide the AI to a better response.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2>3. Example scenarios</h2>
<p>Here is how you can apply the Four C's in different situations during your project.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1: Starting the project</h3>
<p>Your first prompt is crucial for setting the <strong>Context</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A Bad Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"how do i make a temperature thing"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Good Prompt (using the Four C's):</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Context]:</strong> "Hello! I'm a student learning Python and I'm using a <strong>Raspberry Pi Pico</strong> with the <strong>Thonny IDE</strong>. I have a <strong>DHT11 temperature sensor</strong> connected to <strong>GP15</strong>.
<strong>[Clarity]:</strong> I need to write a MicroPython script that reads the temperature and humidity from the sensor.
<strong>[Conciseness]:</strong> Can you provide the basic code to do just that one thing?
<strong>[Constraints]:</strong> Please include comments explaining each part of the code. Don't worry about printing to a display or saving to a file yet."</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenario 2: Asking for a specific function</h3>
<p>When you need a new feature, be <strong>Clear</strong> and <strong>Concise</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A Bad Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"now make it do csv"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Good Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Context]:</strong> "Here is my current MicroPython code: <code>[paste your current, working code]</code>
<strong>[Clarity]:</strong> I want to write the temperature and humidity readings to a <strong>CSV file</strong> on the Pico called <code>data.csv</code>. The file should have three columns: <code>timestamp</code>, <code>temperature_C</code>, and <code>humidity</code>.
<strong>[Conciseness]:</strong> Can you show me how to modify my main loop to open the file, append a new line with the data, and then close it?"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Scenario 3: Debugging an error</h3>
<p>When you have a bug, give the AI all the information. The error message itself is critical <strong>Context</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>A Bad Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"my code is broken"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A Good Prompt:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>[Context]:</strong> "I'm using a <strong>Raspberry Pi Pico</strong> and my code was working, but now it's giving me an error. Here is the full error message I see in Thonny: <code>[paste the complete, exact error message]</code>.
Here is the full script that is causing the error: <code>[paste your full script]</code>.
<strong>[Clarity]:</strong> The error seems to happen on the line <code>[mention the line number or the line of code]</code>. I think the problem is related to converting the sensor reading to a string, but I'm not sure.
<strong>[Constraints]:</strong> Can you explain what this error means and suggest two or three possible ways I could fix it?"</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. What to do when the AI is wrong</h2>
<p><strong>AI models are not perfect.</strong> They will sometimes:
    <br>
- Make up facts or library names ("hallucinate").
    <br>
- Give you code that doesn't run.
    <br>
- Give you code that is inefficient or overly complex.</p>
    <br>
<p><strong>It is your job to be the human in the loop!</strong>
    <br>
- <strong>Always test the code.</strong> Never assume the AI's output is correct.
    <br>
- <strong>Think critically.</strong> Does the explanation make sense? Is there a simpler way to do this?
    <br>
- <strong>Re-prompt if needed.</strong> If you don't get a good answer, try rephrasing your question. Add more context or be more specific. Tell the AI what was wrong with its last response.</p>
    <br>
<p>Good luck!</p>
