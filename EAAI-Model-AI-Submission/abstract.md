This paper introduces a new project-based assignment for introductory AI and programming courses. It positions Large Language Models (LLMs) as collaborative pair programmers, but ensures student agency by requiring feasible, tangible hardware outputs. The goal is to have students get their hands dirty with tasks that an AI cannot do for them.

The assignment asks students to pick a personal project and build it with an AI partner. The key step is validating the final code with a real hardware setup. This moves beyond pure simulation. It compels students to ground their code, and their understanding, in real-world interactions.

Throughout the project, students learn practical skills like prompt engineering, iterative development, and AI-assisted debugging. They keep a reflection journal and submit their AI chats, showing their thought process. Using low-cost hardware ensures students are active participants. They must understand, adapt, and verify the AI's output, not just copy it. This fosters a deeper, more authentic learning experience and shows students how to leverage AI tools effectively. The assignment is highly adaptable, with many project options to promote engagement and creativity.
